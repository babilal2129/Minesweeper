Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

In Minesweeper, mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells.

A player clicks a cell to uncover it. If a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game.

Otherwise, the uncovered cells displays either a number, indicating the quantity of mines diagonally or orthogonally adjacent to it, or a blank tile (or "0"), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered.

To win the game, players must uncover all non-mine cells
